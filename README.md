# Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation
During five year period from 2015 to 2019 were collected data about World Happiness. The features that were choosen to reflect on nationes happines around the world are Economy, Health, Family, Goverment corruption etc.
#  Data Cleaning
Data were first cleand and all datasets were combined together in order to create large dataset. Unfortunately there's no uniform columns accross all datasets. Therefore some corrections were necessary. This proved to be wrong regardless 'Family column', so this idea was abanddoned since this column was influenced by the year data were collected more than others.

# Correlation between data
Correlation between columns have been represented by heatmap.

It is obvious that on nation happiness biggest impact have financial security that steams from high GDP or strong Economy, Health and a little less Freedom, while Trust (Goverment Corruption) and Generosity have less than 0.5 coefficient of correlation with Happines Score.

# Visual representation of Happiest Nationes

Since data used in this notebook are collected during 5 years I am interested how countries are ranked in different years?

From previous table data as well as from graph it's  obvious that best performed through obserbavle years is Denmark, that hold one of the first three position, year by year. Well done **Denmark**.

Now let's see what is going on around less happiest nationes.

This graph show us how many times cearten country was amoungs 10 least happy countries during five year period. Rwanda and Syria hold one of the last teen position during all years.

Data from bottom of the set are more diverse, that is whay we have more countries amoung the teen last positioned.
