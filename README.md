# Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation
During five year period from 2015 to 2019 were collected data about World Happiness. The features that were choosen to reflect on nationes happines around the world are Economy, Health, Family, Goverment corruption etc.
#  Data Cleaning
Data were first cleand and all datasets were combined together in order to create large dataset. Unfortunately there's no uniform columns accross all datasets. Therefore some corrections were necessary. This proved to be wrong regardless 'Family column', so this idea was abanddoned since this column was influenced by the year data were collected more than others.
