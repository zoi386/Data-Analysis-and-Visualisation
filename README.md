# Cleaning Data
Data were first cleand and all datasets were combined together in order to create large dataset. Unfortunately there's no uniform columns accross all datasets. Therefore some corrections were necessary. This proved to be wrong regardless 'Family column', so this idea was abanddoned since this column was influenced by the year data were collected more than others.
